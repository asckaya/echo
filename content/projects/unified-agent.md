**Background**: Built at DiDi LLM Lab to power AI assistant "小滴" - users describe travel needs in one sentence and AI matches the right ride. Existing DeepSeek-V3.1 (671B) model had issues: slow inference, high resource consumption, hallucinations, and tool misuse.

**Solution**: Implemented shared-weight Agent RL framework with Agent-as-Tool mechanism. Served as both infra and algorithm lead. All roles share the same model parameters via different contexts, trained together with trajectory-level reward backpropagation.

**Results**: Achieves better accuracy than DeepSeek V3.1 (671B) on GLM4-Flash (30B MoE) with 10x less compute, faster inference, and higher accuracy.
